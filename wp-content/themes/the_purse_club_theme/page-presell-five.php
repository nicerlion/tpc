										<h1>I've Never Paid Full Price For A Designer Handbag But You Wouldn't Know It</h2>

										<p>Handbags are always a weighted topic for the fashion set - most likely due to their exorbitant prices and the ability of most of us to spot some of the industry's most coveted handheld accoutrements from miles away.</p>
										<p>I admittedly have a thing for bags of the designer persuasion (no surprise there), though the costs of nearly all of the bags I fancy are not within my everyday means. To put it in perspective, a $3K Chanel bag bought on a whim would put my next three months of rent in jeopardy, and though I love all things Lagerfeld, quite frankly, he isn’t keeping a roof over my head and food in my stomach.</p>
										<p>But designer bags still make me SWV-style weak in the knees and I am a woman who does somehow end up getting what she wants. In this day and age of Black Fridays and sample sales, possessing Chanel, Balenciaga, Louis Vuitton, and the like isn’t as out of reach as it used to be and I’ve found a way to own pieces from the aforementioned brands without ever actually shelling out full retail dollars.</p>
										<p>Now that I’ve discovered ways to get the accessories I want without emptying my checking account time and time again, I’m kind of hooked on it. Here a few tips on how you can get the styles you want for a fraction of the price.</p>

										<p><b>1. Buy consignment and vintage.</b> You can certainly find hidden gems at consignment and vintage stores, and at great prices. Each city has at least one consignment shop and I'm lucky to be a native New Yorker because we have a slew of them. The main drawback is that the goods aren’t always in the best shape, and you never know what you’re going to find when you visit.</p>
										<p><b>2. Sales are my friends. I embrace them with open arms.</b> I know, I know: We’re in times of financial uncertainty and we should be saving for a rainy day, but sale season is the best time of the year to shop for yourself. There are so many sales that a fashion-loving woman would be remiss to not take advantage. The only thing that sucks about sales is that the best stuff always goes first and stores will often mark-up goods before they go on sale to make you think you’re saving more than you actually are.</p>
										<p><b>3. Hunt for super savings on deal sites.</b> There are multiple deals sites that I visit frequently, which are stocked with designer bags. I've snagged a vintage LV crossbody bag on BTR for $250. Pretty amazing steal, right? The only thing is problem with</p>
										<p><b>4. Last, but not least, you can take advantage of super savings through purse subscription services like <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a>.</b>  Fashionable subscription clubs are all the rage right now. They provide designer style for low prices. If you are like me and love to change up your look often, then you probably have dreamed of buying a new handbag every month. With purse clubs, you actually get to do just that.  This is my secret to staying up on the latest purse trends without breaking the bank.</p>

										<h4><strong>1. Choose your membership level</strong></h4>
										<p>If this idea is intriguing to you, let me give you a few pointers. I have been using <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a> for a while and I still get excited every month when my new bag comes in the mail. Their site has a cool <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">quiz feature</a> (I’m a sucker for fashion quizzes) that helps you decide which membership is right for you. Then you get to explore some of the purses for each membership level.</p> 
										<h4><strong>2. Follow the crazy simple signup process</strong></h4>
										<p>Once you pick your membership level and sign up, they will immediately send your first new purse. No hidden fees or shipping costs are added to your price. While they do have great taste, you can contact your concierge if you get a bag that you don’t love. Guess what? They will replace it immediately. If you change your mind, you can always cancel. So why not try it out just for fun?</p> 
										<h4><strong>3. Don't forget your discount code!</strong></h4>
										<p>Because I love this club and my lovely blog readers so much, I am able to give you a 50% discount code on your first month so you can try it out. Just click here to claim your code and follow the steps to join! P.S. Did I mention that members are automatically entered into a weekly drawing for a Louis Vuitton bag?! You can <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">click here</a> if you want to check out <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a> for yourself.</p>
