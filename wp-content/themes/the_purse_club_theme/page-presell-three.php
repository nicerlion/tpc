										<p>The first purse I fell in love with was a $30 Guess purse my parents got me at the mall when I was in grade school. This cute little saddlebag had weaves that overlapped each other and tassels. I thought it looked more expensive than it actually cost with a very cool matte black finish. I literally never left the house without this purse! Honestly, I didn't think I could love a purse more. Until I grew up and discovered the remarkably broad and deep world of high quality, designer purses.</p>
										<p>Purses are the perfect marriage of function, art, and personal statement - and if you've thus far neglected the purse as a part of your wardrobe, it's time to correct that. But I'm guessing that if you read PurseAddictMag, you likely already have an appreciation for them, whether your budget is high or low.</p>
										<p>The choice of purse is one of the most common ways modern women express themselves, and for a lot of women a purse is something incredibly personal. I think a big source of purse-avoidance for many women is the perception that a purse is a grave, high-dollar decision you have to get just right. While it's true that in some cases a designer purse may be something that you buy once every couple of years, keep for 30 years, and pass down to your kids, or that you buy pre-owned from a consignment store, that's also akin to buying one $2,000 watch you keep for a few decades - it may not be your lifestyle.</p>
										<p><strong>Nowadays, technology and direct-to-customer sales are revolutionizing how purses are made, sold, and worn by women the world over. Don't you think it's time to explore your options and broaden your horizons?</strong></p>
										<p>This is where a service like <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a> comes in handy.</p>
										<p><a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a> is a monthly subscription service that will send you a new purse every month for you to keep and add to your collection. It's based around two different price points that allow you to customize your options depending on your tastes. If you're like me and are more of a clutch kind of girl, you can rank small bags higher. If you prefer a more everyday style, you can rank casual purses higher. You also rank your preferences for color, prints, materials, as well as hardware.</p>
										<p>Whatever your taste in bags, The Purse Club solves the age-old problem of matching the style and purpose of your purse to a given occasion. If you've followed our Getups over the years, you know how drastically one purse can alter the dress and overall feel of an outfit over a different purse.</p>

									<div class="presell-three-copy">
										<p>The Purse Club makes acquiring your stable of purses super easy with three pricing tiers:</p> <p>The <a href="/perfect-purse-1/"><strong>Gold Tier is $39.95</strong></a> a month and includes purses that are worth $75 to $200.</p>
										<p>The <a href="/perfect-purse-1/"><strong>Platinum Tier is $79.95</strong></a> a month and includes purses worth $200-450.</p>
										<p>No matter what tier you're at with <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a>, you're also eligible to be entered in their weekly Louis Vuitton giveaway which happens every Friday.</p>
										<p>These giveaways are pretty incredible: Every Friday <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a> gives away a Louis Vuitton purse to one of their members. That means for even $39.95 per month with the Gold tier you might come home to find a Parisian designer bag waiting for you in your mailbox (in addition to the up to $200 purses you've been receiving.)</p>

									<div class="presell-three-copy"> 
										<p>What can you expect quality-wise from <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a>? Well, every purse from them is authentic and designed by some of the hottest designers in NY, LA, Miami and Chicago.</p> 
										<p>The Purse Club sent PurseAddictMag a few samples from the different levels and we are impressed.</p> 
										<p>At the Gold tier they sent us their brand new Georgie. This beautiful bowler style bag combines a vintage shape with modern details. Its crocodile pattern is etched in vegan friendly leather and adds instant sophistication to any outfit. It even comes with a matching wallet.</p>

									<div class="presell-three-copy"> 
										<p>Over the past decade or so purses have become large and oversized (even clutches) so it's nice to see some of the smaller manufacturers moving back to a bit more reasonable size.</p> 
										<p>At the Platinum tier we were sent the Mirielle. This elegant crossbody is perfect for anyone wanting to dress up their look. The quilted pattern compliments its jet black color and convertible gold plated chain. Although it appears small enough to be wore as an evening bag it has enough room to pack all of your daily necessities. </p>

										<p>Now, you might be wondering -</p> 
									</div> 
									<div class="presell-three-copy"> <h3>What happens if I get a purse I don't like?</h3> 
										<p><a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a> has an amazing 24/7 concierge desk that you can call to exchange your purse, as long as it hasn't been used. So even if you get a purse that you think is the ugliest damn thing you've ever seen that's okay because I guarantee you'll have a great experience with The Purse Club's concierge service. That type of care for their customers is what makes them so unique, and such a rewarding club to join.</p> 
										<p>Purse connoisseurs will fight over some of the craziest things. For example, is it okay to wear black heels with a brown clutch? My two cents: it depends on the clutch! If it's something subtle then I say go for it. After all, it's better to be unique and confident than conservative and a wallflower!</p> 
										<p><a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a> offers women at every stage of their personal purse journey - from just starting out to fanatic - a perfect way to start a collection, fill out their existing purse stable, and experience the pleasure of getting a well-curated designer bag each month.</p> 
										<p>Along with the sheer enjoyment of the surprise, you'll also be giving your overall style a huge boost.
