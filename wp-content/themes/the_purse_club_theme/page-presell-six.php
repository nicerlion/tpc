											<p>Fashion is fickle and no more so is this true than in high-end accessories. Trends come and go, lasting only a year or two, before a another one comes along tugging dollars in a new direction. The luxury handbag industry, however, has occupied an untouchable position in the fashion world. This segment of the fashion industry has largely dictated its own trends, and the dollars spent on them, by creating "it" bags, carefully crafting waiting lists, and controlling marketing, pricing, and manufacturing.</p>
											<p>Here are several surprising ways the top designers have had a stranglehold on the handbag industry, and why this grip is loosening, allowing exciting new talent to rise up and make their mark.</p>
											<h4>One-Source Manufacturing</h4>
											<p>A quick stroll down Fifth Avenue or Rodeo Drive reveals window after window of the latest must-have fashion trends designed to appeal to a woman's desire to make a fashion statement, especially when it comes to handbags. Touting the finest leather, attention to detail, and expert tooling by the world's greatest craftsmen, these luxury handbags are positioned as unique, one-of-a-kind purchases.</p>
											<p>Yet, a large number of these designer purses not only occupy neighboring retail windows, they are manufactured in one small town in Spain called Ubrique. According to BBC Business, workers in this unlikely enclave in southern Spain toil side by side making most of the leather products for high-end luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Hermes, Chanel, Chloe, Loewe, and Caroline Herrera.</p>
											<p>The production is conducted under a veil of secrecy for all workers, from laborers to factory heads, have to sign strict confidentiality contracts. This secrecy has also prevented lesser-known manufacturers from having access to these craftsmen, in effect allowing the big designers to corner the manufacturing market.</p>
											<h4>Market Manipulation</h4>
											<p>The top select brands in the designer world control over 75% of the $225 billion luxury fashion industry, meaning they've been operating unchallenged for years, determining pricing and supply. And, according to Forbes, upscale handbags have the highest markup in luxury goods, selling for 12 to 20 times the cost of production.</p>
											<p>As these top designer companies jockey for market share, they also routinely inflate prices, regardless of whether they align with inflation rates or production costs. As a result, these companies often artificially position themselves as luxury products</p>
											<p>And it has worked. The rise in sales of handbags in the United States alone over the last two decades has been seemingly unstoppable, peaking at $11.3 billion in 2015. But every juggernaut loses steam at some point, and designer purses are no exception. In the last five years, sales have gone from a growth rate of 16% to just 3% predicted for 2017</p>

										<p class="presell-six-caption">Creative Lab / Shutterstock.com<br>Renowned brands with prominent logos have fallen out of favor by the new generation, that is logo-adverse.</p>
										<div class="presell-six-copy">
											<h4>Oversaturation, the Death of Design, and Logo No-go</h4>
											<p>With the slowdown in handbag sales, big-name designers are fighting to maintain market share, at the cost of new design and innovation. In recent years, top handbag designers aren't spending as much on new designs, but rather trying to mass market their top sellers. They're offering the same product year after year, while inflating prices at the same time.</p>
											<p>Not only does this hurt the industry in terms of innovation, the market saturation works against these top designers as well. If women are all buying the same handbag, the cache of obtaining something unique and special evaporates quickly.</p>
											<p>All of this is compounded by the fact that the millennial generation, which is the largest generation the United States has ever seen, has less to spend on luxury goods thanks to the school debt they're saddled with before they even enter the workforce.</p>
											<p>This generation is also logo-adverse. According to a report conducted by Goldman Sachs, teenagers and young adults have a disdain for logos, forcing handbag companies like Coach, Kate Spade, and Michael Kors to tone down their branding. Because they've grown up in an age where they're relentlessly inundated with marketing messages, millennials love the idea of uniqueness and they don't like to be told what they should wear or what purse they should carry.</p>

											<h3>Make Room for Bold, New Handbag Designers</h3>
											<p>While it would seem that through controlling trends, pricing, and manufacturing, only a few labels have cornered the luxury handbag market. In reality, they've painted themselves into a corner. The good news is that this leaves room for smaller, more creative newcomers to emerge who aren't charging the hefty prices of their predecessors.</p>
											<p>Take, for example, The Purse Club. The Purse Club is an innovative start-up that's disrupting the luxury bag industry by offering trendy and stylish purses at a fraction of the cost of top designer handbags.</p>
											<p>The Purse Club taps the hottest designers from New York, Los Angeles, Miami, and Chicago, who've cracked into the exclusive manufacturing world of the iconic bag makers. These newcomers are bringing handcrafted, original, and most important, affordable purses to the market.</p>
											<p><strong>Starting at $39 per month</strong>, The Purse Club sends a new bag each month to its subscribers, delivering 12 purses for the price of one high-end name brand purse every year. The purses reflect real trends, affording clients the chance to show off many new styles throughout the year.</p>
											<p><strong>For $79 per month</strong>, The Purse Club offers an upgraded Platinum service that delivers exclusive designer-quality handbags that feature genuine leather, vegan leather, printed sateen linings, and visual hardware.</p>
											<p>This new pricing transparency allows consumers access to stylish, expertly-crafted handbags, without having to pay the exorbitant prices dictated by a select few designer labels.</p>
											<p>To get started, new customers answer a few simple questions regarding the style of bags they're interested in, their favorite handbag colors, and what size they're looking for. The Purse Club does the rest and delivers a new handbag each month right to their doors.</p>
											<p>As the top luxury handbag designers fight to remain relevant, consumers are reaping the benefits by gaining access to ground-breaking new designers who are shaping the future of handbags.To check out some of the exciting designer purses and take a style quiz, visit The Purse Club at www.thepurseclub.com.</p>
