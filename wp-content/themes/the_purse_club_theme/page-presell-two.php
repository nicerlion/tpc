								<h2>This is the Startup That Purse Lovers Have Been Waiting For</h2>
								<div class="presell-two-subtitle">:: This “Purse of the Month” Club is Shaking up the Designer Bag Industry</div>

								<p>Purse lovers are in for a special treat. <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a>, at only 9 months old, has become the largest and most loved purse of the month club in the world. They have absolutely exploded since the famous reality TV star sisters started posting about them on Instagram. It's true, the Sisters are members of <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club.</a></p>

									<p>For $39, <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a> ships you a new purse that you get to KEEP (not like those rental sites!) worth up to 5x what you pay. It works a lot like many other monthly clubs where you pay a low membership fee and get products worth more than you paid. <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a> is doing things a bit differently, though. One member of The Purse Club wins a Louis Vuitton bag every Friday! That is something worth checking out, so I did. $39 gets you designer purses worth up to $200 each. They have partnerships with the hottest designers in New York, LA, Miami and Chicago, which means that they always one step ahead of the current purse trends.</p>

								<p>I signed up pretty easily at <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">www.thepurseclub.com.</a> I love purses and my style always changes (I like to change my look with the seasons!), so I signed up for a year. That got me my membership for only $39.95 a month... pretty cheap. At first, I thought I might be renting these purses, but it turns out - you KEEP everything they send you, even the Louis Vuitton if you win!</p>
							</div>
							<div class="presell-two-copy margin-b-27">
								<h2 class="margin-b-20">How do you spot the fakes?</h2>
								<p>Here are a few tips from the experts at Forbes Magazine <br> <br> The second way to spot a fake is by examining the stitching. Is the stitching even? It should be perfect. <br> <br> Usually, fake Louis Vuitton’s will have back-and-forth stitching – that’s a sign of sloppy construction that doesn’t meet Louis Vuitton’s high standards. Examine the bag carefully for this sign of a possible counterfeit. <br> <br> Last but not least, does the pattern match? Look closely at the matching of the pattern in the outside seams. A company like Louis Vuitton, which values its logo, wouldn’t divide the letters in a seam. And where the pattern appears on either side of the seam, it should match precisely.</p>

										<p><i>The Purse Club is absolutely incredible… During this era of monthly clubs providing everything from clothes to shoes to video games, finally having a club that caters to the purse connoisseur is something really special!  What is really impressive is that the purses are both trendy and fashionable. The special offers for high-end purses are pretty cool, but receiving a new, unique top-tier purse every month is like Christmas every 30 days.  If you love exquisite purses and are an enthusiast, a connoisseur or a collector, The Purse Club is where you need to be!</i></p>

								<h2 class="margin-b-20">Here is my review for purse number 1:</h2>
								<p class="margin-b-27">They ship you a new purse every 30 days.  Even though you can login and pick which purse you want next, I actually let them pick for me.  That way it's always a surprise, which I really love. I was so happy when I got my box in the mail to see what I was getting!  It feels like Christmas every month.</p>

									<p>This purse is awesome. I'm definitely a fan of this purse! I searched for it and found it on Amazon for $129. I'm amazed at the value. <br><br> So even though I didn't win the Louis Vuitton (at least for this week!), I am SO happy with the purse I got! It is $200 MSRP ($129 on Amazon) so I definitely feel like I got a great deal for my low membership fee. <br><br> <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a> gives away free months, free phone cases, mirrors, makeup brushes, multiple Louis Vuitton and Gucci purses and more.</p>
									<p>So... what if you don't love the purse? - Great question. <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">The Purse Club</a> actually offers an exchange program! So if you get a purse that doesn't fit your style, you can easily trade it for something else you love! What an amazing company!</p>

									I have to say, <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">I am 100% behind this company.</a> They have an amazing community of purse lovers and they truly care about their customers. I'm getting stylish, high quality purses for a super low membership fee and a chance to get my very own Louis Vuitton every week. They used to do one Louis Vuitton a month, and as they've grown, they keep adding more! They giveaway one Louis Vuitton every Friday - live on their <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">Instagram page.</a> Go to <a href="/perfect-purse-1/">www.thepurseclub.com</a> and sign up!</p>
